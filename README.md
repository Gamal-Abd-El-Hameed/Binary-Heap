# Binary-Heap
A program that implements some basic procedures of binary heap and show how they could be used in a sorting algorithm comparing it to other sorting algorithms: Merge Sort, Quick Sort and Selection Sort.
# The Basic Procedures:
## 1. MAX-HEAPIFY :
which runs in O(lg n) time, is the key to maintaining
the max-heap property.
## 2. BUILD-MAX-HEAP :
which runs in linear time, produces a max-heapfrom an unordered input array.
## 3. HEAPSORT :
which runs in O(n lg n) time, sorts an array in place.

## 4. MAX-HEAP-INSERT, and HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX:
which run in O(lg n) time, allow the heap data structure to implement a priority queue.
# Sorting Techniques
The program implements the “heapsort” algorithm as an application for binary heaps and compare the running time performance of your algorithms against:
* An O(n<sup>2</sup>) sorting algorithm such as Selection Sort.
* An O(n lg n) sorting algorithm such as Merge Sort and Quick sort.

The program generates a dataset of random numbers and plot the relationship between the execution time of the sorting
algorithm versus the input size.
